# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
using the features in the provided dataset that help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

## Results

For the first model, I used 2 hidden layers with "relu" activation function for training because its simple a first approach. Secondly, I used "sigmoid" to activate function.
80 neurons in the first layer and 30 neurons in the second because a "sigmoid" as a output activate function. This model had an accuracy of 72.45%, not ba, but not the 75% requested, and a lost of 55.94%.

Unlike first model, I used 3 hiden layers. 1st and 2nd layers were same as first model, but I added 3rd layer with 10 neurons. As we expected, the accuracy was improved and the loss was down. The rate of aaccuracy 78.95% and the rate of loss 44.02%

In the first model, I dropped "EIN","NAME". Unlike the first modelI dropped "EIN", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS" for the second model.

## Summary
Optimizing the model we exceeded the accuracy of 75%! So, this model has an accuracy of 78.95% to determine if an applicant orgaization will be successful.
